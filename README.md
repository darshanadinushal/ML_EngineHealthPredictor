# 🚗 Smart Engine Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Engine Monitoring System** is a Machine Learning-based system designed to analyze engine diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and predict engine health conditions. By leveraging historical error occurrences, engine operating hours, and system statuses, the model provides insights into potential faults and maintenance needs, reducing downtime and improving vehicle efficiency.

## 🔥 Key Features
- 📊 **Predict Engine Operating Hours** based on diagnostic data and error occurrences.
- ⚠️ **Identify Recurring Faults** and estimate the likelihood of future issues.
- 🔍 **Analyze Error Trends** to determine potential failures before they escalate.
- 📈 **Improve Maintenance Planning** by forecasting engine conditions based on real-time and historical data.
- 🚀 **Enhance Fleet Efficiency** through proactive diagnostics and reduced repair costs.

## 🎯 Use Case
This model is ideal for:
- **Fleet management**: Predict engine failures and optimize maintenance schedules.
- **Automotive maintenance services**: Provide proactive repair insights.
- **Manufacturers**: Monitor vehicle performance and detect early warning signs of failure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📉
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒

## 📊 Model Training
- Prepare the dataset by cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Train a **Linear Regression** model to predict engine health metrics.
- Evaluate the model performance using **R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

## 🏆 Expected Outcomes
- Improved **predictive maintenance** by forecasting engine faults.
- Reduced **repair costs** through early issue detection.
- Increased **vehicle uptime** by preventing unexpected breakdowns.
